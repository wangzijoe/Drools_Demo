  Drools Fusion is the module responsible for enabling event processing
  behavior.</p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d0e28"/>1.1. Complex Event Processing</h2></div></div></div><p>Although several tries were made, there isn't up to date any broadly
  accepted definition on the term Complex Event Processing. The term Event by
  itself is frequently overloaded and used to refer to several different
  things, depending on the context it is used. Defining terms is not the goal
  of this guide and as so, lets adopt a loose definition that, although not
  formal, will allow us to proceed with a common understanding.</p><p>So, in the scope of this guide:</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="important"><h2>Important</h2><p><a id="d0e37" class="indexterm"/> <span class="bold"><strong>Event</strong></span>, is a record of a
    significant change of state in the application domain.</p></div><p>For instance, on a Stock Broker application, when a sell operation is
  executed, it causes a change of state in the domain. This change of state
  can be observed on several entities in the domain, like the price of the
  securities that changed to match the value of the operation, the owner of
  the individual traded assets that change from the seller to the buyer, the
  balance of the accounts from both seller and buyer that are credited and
  debited, etc. Depending on how the domain is modelled, this change of state
  may be represented by a single event, multiple atomic events or even
  hierarchies of correlated events. In any case, in the context of this guide,
  Event is the record of the change on a particular data in the domain.</p><p>Events are processed by computer systems since they were invented, and
  throughout the history, systems responsible for that were given different
  names and different methodologies were employed. It wasn't until the 90's
  though, that a more focused work started on EDA (Event Driven Architecture)
  with a more formal definition on the requirements and goals for event
  processing. Old messaging systems started to change to address such
  requirements and new systems started to be developed with the single purpose
  of event processing. Two trends were born under the names of Event Stream
  Processing and Complex Event Processing.</p><p>In the very beginnings, Event Stream Processing was focused on the
  capabilities of processing streams of events in (near) real time, where the
  main focus of Complex Event Processing was on the correlation and
  composition of atomic events into complex (compound) events. An important
  (maybe the most important) milestone was the publishing of the Dr. David
  Luckham's book "The Power of Events" in 2002. In the book, Dr Luckham
  introduces the concept of Complex Event Processing and how it can be used to
  enhance systems that deal with events. Over the years, both trends converged
  to a common understanding and today these systems are all referred as CEP
  systems.</p><p>This is a very simplistic explanation to a really complex and fertile
  field of research, but sets a very high level and common understanding for
  the concepts this guide will introduce.</p><p>The current understanding of what Complex Event Processing is may be
  briefly described as the following quote from Wikipedia:</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="important"><h2>Important</h2><div class="blockquote"><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="blockquote" summary="Block quote"><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td width="80%" valign="top"><p>"<a id="d0e62" class="indexterm"/><span class="bold"><strong>Complex Event
      Processing</strong></span>, or CEP, is primarily an event processing concept
      that deals with the task of processing multiple events with the goal of
      identifying the meaningful events within the event cloud. CEP employs
      techniques such as detection of complex patterns of many events, event
      correlation and abstraction, event hierarchies, and relationships
      between events such as causality, membership, and timing, and
      event-driven processes."</p></td><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td width="10%" valign="top"> </td><td colspan="2" align="right" valign="top">--<span class="attribution"><em class="citetitle"><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing" target="">Wikipedia</a></em></span></td></tr></table></div></div><p>In other words, CEP is about detecting and selecting the interesting
  events (and only them) from an event cloud, finding their relationships and
  inferring new data from them and their relationships.</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="note"><h2>Note</h2><p>For the remaining of this guide, we will use the terms 
   <span class="bold"><strong>Complex Event Processing</strong></span>
  and <span class="bold"><strong>CEP</strong></span> as a broad reference for any of 
  the related technologies
  and techniques, including but not limited to, CEP, Complex Event Processing,
  ESP, Event Stream Processing and Event Processing in general.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="d0e79"/>1.2. Drools Fusion</h2></div></div></div><p>Event Processing use cases, in general, share several requirements and
  goals with Business Rules use cases. These overlaps happen both on the
  business side and on the technical side.</p><p>On the Business side:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Business rules are frequently defined based on the occurrence of
      scenarios triggered by events. Examples could be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>On an algorithmic trading application: take an action if the
          security price increases X% compared to the day opening price, where
          the price increases are usually denoted by events on a Stock Trade
          application.</p></li><li><p>On a monitoring application: take an action if the temperature
          on the server room increases X degrees in Y minutes, where sensor
          readings are usually denoted by events.</p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>Both business rules and event processing queries change frequently
      and require immediate response for the business to adapt itself to new
      market conditions, new regulations and new enterprise policies.</p></li></ul></div><p>From a technical perspective:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Both require seamless integration with the enterprise
      infrastructure and applications, specially on autonomous governance,
      including, but not limited to, lifecycle management, auditing, security,
      etc.</p></li><li><p>Both have functional requirements like pattern matching and
      non-functional requirements like response time and query/rule
      explanation.</p></li></ul></div><p>Even sharing requirements and goals, historically, both fields were
  born appart and although the industry evolved and one can find good products
  on the market, they either focus on event processing or on business rules
  management. That is due not only because of historical reasons but also
  because, even overlapping in part, use cases do have some different
  requirements.</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:rf="java:org.jboss.highlight.XhtmlRendererFactory" class="important"><h2>Important</h2><p>Drools was also born as a rules engine several years ago, but
    following the vision of becoming a single platform for behavioral
    modelling, it soon realized that it could only achieve this goal by
    crediting the same importance to the three complementary business
    modelling techniques:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Business Rules Management</p></li><li><p>Business Processes Management</p></li><li><p>Complex Event Processing</p></li></ul></div></div><p>In this context, Drools Fusion is the module responsible for adding
  event processing capabilities into the platform. </p><p>Supporting Complex Event Processing, though, is much more than simply
  understanding what an event is. CEP scenarios share several common and
  distinguishing characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Usually required to process huge volumes of events, but only a
      small percentage of the events are of real interest.</p></li><li><p>Events are usually immutable, since they are a record of state
      change.</p></li><li><p>Usually the rules and queries on events must run in reactive
      modes, i.e., react to the detection of event patterns.</p></li><li><p>Usually there are strong temporal relationships between related
      events.</p></li><li><p>Individual events are usually not important. The system is
      concerned about patterns of related events and their
      relationships.</p></li><li><p>Usually, the system is required to perform composition and
      aggregation of events.</p></li></ul></div><p>Based on this general common characteristics, Drools Fusion defined a
  set of goals to be achieved in order to support Complex Event Processing
  appropriately:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>Support Events, with their proper semantics, as first class
      citizens.</p></li><li><p>Allow detection, correlation, aggregation and composition of
      events.</p></li><li><p>Support processing of Streams of events.</p></li><li><p>Support temporal constraints in order to model the temporal
      relationships between events.</p></li><li><p>Support sliding windows of interesting events.</p></li><li><p>Support a session scoped unified clock.</p></li><li><p>Support the required volumes of events for CEP use cases.</p></li><li><p>Support to (re)active rules.</p></li><li><p>Support adapters for event input into the engine
      (pipeline).</p></li></ul></div><p>The above list of goals are based on the requirements not covered by
  Drools Expert itself, since in a unified platform, all features of one
  module are leveraged by the other modules. This way, Drools Fusion is born
  with enterprise grade features like Pattern Matching, that is paramount to a
  CEP product, but that is already provided by Drools Expert. In the same way,
  all features provided by Drools Fusion are leveraged by Drools Flow (and
  vice-versa) making process management aware of event processing and
  vice-versa.</p><p>For the remaining of this guide, we will go through each of the
  features Drools Fusion adds to the platform. All these features are
  available to support different use cases in the CEP world, and the user is
  free to select and use the ones that will help him model his business use
  case.</p></div></div><ul xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" class="docnav"><li class="previous"><a accesskey="p" href="pr01.html"><strong>Prev</strong></a></li><li class="up"><a accesskey="u" href="#"><strong>Top of page</strong></a></li><li class="home"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><strong>Front page</strong></a></li><li class="next"><a accesskey="n" href="ch02.html"><strong>Next</strong>Chapter 2. Drools Fusion Features</a></li></ul></body></html>
